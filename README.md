# Grapher2D.js

Grapher2D.js is a javascript library based off of my [Grapher2D](https://github.com/sharhar/Grapher2D) application that is written in C. Just like the desktop applicaation, Grapher2D.js uses OpenGL to quickly graph complex mathematical functions onto the screen.

Grapher2D.js currently uses WebGL 2.0 with the [EXT_color_buffer_float](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EXT_color_buffer_float) extension. WebGL 1.0 functionality is planned for browers that do not support the newer standard, but implicit graphing is unlikely to be implemented.
